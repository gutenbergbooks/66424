<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="ph3">THE ORPHAN OF THE TEMPLE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who would follow the story of
the dark days in the Temple, can do
so best by the perusal of the record
left by Madame Royale herself.
Written with an almost naive simplicity,
it is touching in the highest
degree, while incidentally it affords
graphic pictures of the various members
of the royal family.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, is Marie Antoinette
sketched to the life. “Her
calm contempt and her dignified air
generally struck them (the municipal
officers) with respect. They seldom
ventured to speak to her.”</p>

<p>“We passed the entire day together,”
writes the princess. “My
father gave a lesson in geography to
my brother; my mother made him
read some pages of history, and learn
some verses, and my aunt gave him
a lesson in arithmetic. My father
was so fortunate as to find a library
which gave him occupation; my mother
employed her time in working
embroidery.... My aunt spent
the greater part of her time in praying,
and always read the prayers of
the day. She read a great number
of books of piety, which my mother
frequently requested her to read
aloud.”</p>

<p>Every day exposed the prisoners
to fresh insults.</p>

<p>“Antoinette pretends to be
proud,” said Rocher, one of their
guards, “but I have brought her
pride down. She, her daughter,
and Elizabeth bow as they pass me,
in spite of themselves. They must
bend to me, for I keep the wicket
low. Every night I puff my smoke
into the eyes of Elizabeth as she
passes.” “Ca ira” was sung under the
King’s windows, and he was openly
threatened from time to time with
death. After the end of September
he was separated from his family,
and they were only allowed to meet
at meals. At these times they were
only permitted to converse in a loud
tone, and in French, and Madame
Elizabeth was severely rebuked by
one of the guards because she spoke
to her brother in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">{306}</span></p>

<p>In December and January came the King’s
trial and condemnation. The agony of these
days of suspense to the Queen, her sister, and
her children, cannot be described. When the
fatal sentence was pronounced, they were
allowed one parting interview. The story of
that farewell has often been told. It lasted
for nearly two hours and a half. When the
moment of separation came, Madame Royale
swooned at her father’s feet, and had to be
borne away by the faithful Cléry, from whom
she was snatched by one of the municipal
officers, who carried her roughly to her room.
All the night she fell from one swoon to
another, and her aunt only left her to
prostrate herself before the crucifix in an
agony of prayer.</p>

<p>“The Queen had scarcely strength sufficient
left to undress my brother and put him to
bed. She herself lay down in her clothes,
and all night long we could hear her shivering
with cold and anguish.” The King had
promised to see them again in the morning,
but he deemed it better not to expose them
to the further ordeal. The beat of the drums
and the shouts of the people told them that all
was over.</p>

<p>“Nothing succeeded in calming the anguish
of my mother,” writes Madame Royale; “life
or death had become indifferent to her. She
sometimes gazed at us with a piteously
forlorn air that made us shudder. Happily my
own illness was increased by sorrow, and this
gave my poor mother some occupation.”</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette was unwilling to walk in
the garden of the Temple after her husband’s
death, for in so doing she was obliged to pass
the door of the room where he had been
confined. Afraid, however, that the want of
air would tell on her children’s health, she
obtained leave to walk with them on the top
of the Tower. The platform was, however,
surrounded with lattice work, and the air-holes
were carefully stopped. The Queen asked to
have a door opened between her room and
that of Madame Elizabeth, but this request,
after being referred to the Council General,
was refused. At all hours—sometimes in the
dead of night—their rooms were invaded by
the municipals, or by commissaries of the
convention, often intoxicated, who rudely
searched every corner, and took away whatever
little trifles they could find. “They
searched even beneath our mattresses,” says
Madame Royale, on one occasion; “my poor
brother was sleeping. They tore him roughly
from his bed that they might search it, and
my mother held him in her arms, quite
benumbed with cold.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of July the Convention
ordered that the Dauphin should be separated
from his mother, and committed to the guardianship
of Simon, the shoemaker, in another
part of the Tower. A terrible scene ensued
when this decree was communicated to the
hapless prisoners. The poor boy—he was
only eight years old—threw himself with cries
of terror into his mother’s arms for protection,
and Marie Antoinette for more than an hour
defended the bed on which she laid him
against the municipal officers, protesting
that they should kill her before they should
take away her child. “At length they
grew enraged, and threatened so positively
to kill both him and me, that her love
for us once more compelled her to yield. My
aunt and I took my brother out of bed, as my
mother herself had no strength left; and, as
soon as he was dressed, she took him in her
arms, and, after bathing him in her tears,
which were the more bitter as she foresaw that
it was the last time she should ever see him,
she placed him herself in the hands of the
municipal officers.”</p>

<p>The mother’s cup of sorrows was nearly full.
Madame Royale thus pictures the days that
followed:—</p>

<p>“We ascended to the top of the Tower
very frequently, because my brother also
walked there at his side of the building, and
the only pleasure my mother now had was to
get an occasional distant glimpse of him
through a small slit in the division wall. She
used to remain there for entire hours, watching
the moment when she could see her child.
This was her only desire, her only solace, and
her only occupation.”</p>

<p>A month later Marie Antoinette’s own
turn came, and she was removed to the Conciergerie.
She rose up, and submitted herself
in silence.</p>

<p>“My mother, having first tenderly embraced
me and exhorted me to take courage, to pay
every attention to my aunt, and to obey her
as a second mother, repeated to me the religious
instructions I had before received from
my father, and then, throwing herself into the
arms of my aunt, she recommended her children
to her care. I could not utter a word in
reply, so overwhelmed was I at the thought
that it might be the last time I should see
her. My aunt said a few words to her in a
low voice of anguish and despair. My mother
then hastened from the room without casting
another look towards us, fearful, no doubt,
lest her firmness should desert her. She was
stopped for some time at the bottom of the
stairs while the municipal officers drew up a
<i>procès verbal</i> for the keeper of the prison as a
discharge for her person. In passing through
the prison gate she struck her head against
the wicket, her thoughts being so occupied
that she forgot to stoop. She was asked if
she had hurt herself. ‘Oh, no,’ said she;
‘nothing now can hurt me.’”</p>

<p>Madame Royale and her aunt were now
left alone. Inconsolable at the loss of the
Queen, they made constant and urgent inquiries
concerning her, and begged earnestly
to be reunited to her. They were only told,
however, in the vaguest terms that no harm
would come to her. In September the rigour
of their imprisonment was increased. They
were confined to one room, and no longer
allowed a servant to do the coarse work.
“We made our beds ourselves, and were
obliged to sweep the room, which took us a
long time to do at first, until we got accustomed
to it.” They were not allowed to walk
on the Tower, for fear they should attempt to
escape, although the windows were all barred.
Anything that could tend in any way to their
comfort or convenience was taken away.
Madame Elizabeth asked for something instead
of meat on fast days. She was told that
under the new rules of equality there was no
difference between the days. When she asked
another time, she was told, “No one but fools
believe now in all that nonsense.” In spite of
these refusals, however, she managed to keep
Lent strictly when it came. She took no
breakfast, and reserved the coffee then provided
for her dinner, while at night she only
took bread. She wisely, however, forbade
Madame Royale following her example, and
urged her to eat whatever was brought, saying
she had not yet come to an age which required
her to abstain. In the winter evenings
she taught her niece tric-trac, which they
played together, “as a sort of distraction to
our grief.” As the days began to get longer,
however, they were not allowed any more
candles, and had to go to bed as soon as it
was dark.</p>

<p>The beautiful prayer composed by Madame
Elizabeth, which the aunt and niece used
daily, shows us the pure influence which was
helping to mould Madame Royale’s character,
and the spirit in which days of dreariness and
grief were met and conquered:—</p>

<p>“What may befall me this day, O God! I
know not; but I do know that nothing can
happen to me which Thou hast not foreseen,
ruled, willed, and ordained from all eternity;
and that suffices me. I adore Thy eternal and
inscrutable designs. I submit to them with
all my heart, through love to Thee. I accept
all; I make unto Thee a sacrifice of all; and
to this poor sacrifice I add that of my Divine
Saviour. In His name, and for the sake of
His infinite merits, I ask of Thee that I may
be endowed with patience under suffering, and
with the perfect submission which is due to
all which Thou willest or permittest.”</p>

<p>All this time they remained ignorant of the
fate of the Queen. They had, indeed, heard
the street hawkers crying the sentence of
death under their windows; but, though their
hearts misgave them at times, they refused to
believe that the sentence could have been actually
carried out, and so hoped against hope.
Whether from callous indifference or because
no one had the heart to tell them, the fatal
news never reached their ears, and it was
eighteen months before Madame Royale knew
of her mother’s death.</p>

<p>Thus the days passed until the 9th of May,
1794. The day had been spent as usual, and
the prisoners were just going to bed, when
loud and continued knocking at the door and
demands for immediate admission warned
them of some new evil. The summons was
for Madame Elizabeth. “Citizen, will you accompany
us downstairs?” “And my niece?”
“She shall be taken care of afterwards.”
Madame Elizabeth embraced her niece, and
told her, by way of reassuring her, that she
would soon return. “No, citizen,” said the
ruffians; “you will not return. Put on your
bonnet and go downstairs.” “She bore it all
with patience,” says Madame Royale, “put
on her bonnet, embraced me once more, and
told me to take courage and be firm, to place
my hope in God, to live in the good principles
of religion which my parents had taught me,
and to keep constantly in my mind the last
advice of my father and mother. She then
departed.”</p>

<p>The young girl of fifteen was thus left, as
she herself expresses it, “in an utter state of
desolation.” She “passed a cruel night”;
but, though filled with fears, she could not
believe that serious harm could be intended
to one who was so saintly and pure, and who
could never be accused of taking any share in
the Government or of any political offence.
She was told the next day, in answer to her
inquiries, that her aunt had been to take the
air. She little thought that Madame Elizabeth
had even then travelled her last journey
and reached her long home.</p>

<p>Madame Royale’s health did not sink under
these accumulated sorrows, heavy and bitter
though they were. Hué, her father’s faithful
attendant, writes of her:—“She had attained
an age in which sorrows are keenly felt, but
had learned by great examples to show herself
superior to adversity. Left entirely by
herself in the Tower of the Temple, God being
her only adviser and support, she increased in
grace and virtue, and grew like the lily which
the tempest spared.” The loving foresight of
her aunt doubtless contributed in great measure
to the preservation of her health. She
had planned out the days for her, appointing
set times for prayer, reading, work, and the
care of her room. She had taught her to do
everything for herself, showed her how to
freshen the air of the room by sprinkling
water, and had made her take regular exercise
by walking rapidly, watch in hand, for
an hour at a time. She saw no one except
the municipal officers, who continued to search
her room at frequent intervals, and the persons
who brought her meals. To the latter she
never spoke; to the former only to answer
briefly a direct question. Madame Elizabeth
had impressed on her that if ever she were left
alone, she should immediately ask to have a
woman to live with her. She felt obliged to
obey her aunt’s wish, but feared that if her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">{307}</span>
request were granted, some uncongenial person
would be given her for a companion. It
was, however, refused, and the princess confesses
that she was very glad.</p>

<p>So the long summer days passed away, and
the autumn came and went. Day followed
day in a dreary sameness of solitude. The
Princess of France grew to be thankful for
very small mercies. “I continued at least to
keep myself clean,” she writes. “I had soap
and water, and I swept my room every day....
I was not allowed any light; but in the
long days I did not much feel this privation.
They refused to give me any other books;
those I had were books of piety and travels,
which I had read over and over a thousand
times. I also had a knitting machine, of
which I was completely tired.”</p>

<p>The appointment of a fresh commissary of
the Convention, named Laurent, to take
charge of the princess and her brother,
brought some little relief. The unhappy
Dauphin, after enduring
six months’ brutal
treatment from Simon,
had been left six
months unattended
and alone, and was
reduced to the last
degree of misery.
Laurent, who seems
to have been a kind-hearted
man, did what
he could for him, and
treated Madame Royale
with civility and
consideration. She
ventured to ask for
news of her mother
and her aunt, and
asked him to use his
influence to have her
restored to her mother,
but “he replied
with an evident air of
embarrassment and
pain, that these were
matters with which he
had no concern.”</p>

<p>“The winter passed
with tolerable tranquillity,”
writes the princess,
“and I had reason
to be satisfied
with the civility of my
keepers. They offered to make my fire, and
allowed me as much wood as I wished, which
was a source of great comfort to me. They
also brought me the books I asked for; Laurent
had already procured me some. The greatest
distress I had was in not being able to learn
anything respecting my mother or my aunt.”</p>

<p>The course of the spring of 1795 was
marked only by the gradual fading away of
the Dauphin. The Committee of General
Safety sent physicians at last, and fresh
keepers strove by their kindness to compensate
in some feeble measure for the past
cruelties he had endured, but it was too late.
He grew weaker and weaker, then fever set
in, which he had no strength to resist, and he
died on the 9th of June. The poor child was
only a little over ten years old.</p>

<p>With the death of her brother, Madame
Royale’s memoirs come to a conclusion, but
we learn from other sources what followed.</p>

<p>The Government seem to have felt they had
gone too far. A feeling of pity for “the
daughter of the last King” began to be
awakened. A petition was presented from
the City of Orleans, urging that she should be
restored to freedom, and negotiations were
set on foot which had in view an exchange of
the princess for some prisoners in the custody
of the Austrian Government. Meanwhile
Madame Royale was treated with much
greater consideration, and a lady, Madame de
Chantereine, was appointed to attend on her.</p>

<p>Above all her old friends, Madame de
Tourzel, and her daughter, Pauline, and
Madame de Mackan, former sub-governess to
the children of France, were, after some
difficulty, allowed to visit the Temple.
Madame de Tourzel, in her memoirs, has left
us many details of their first meeting.</p>

</div>

<p>They had left the princess feeble and
delicate, and were surprised to find her
beautiful, tall, and strong, and with that air
of distinction which was her peculiar
characteristic, while they traced in her the
features of the King, the Queen, and even of
Madame Elizabeth. She had much to tell
them of all three, and they drew from her
many touching particulars of her solitary
captivity. She confessed she had grown so
weary of her profound solitude, that she had
said to herself that she should not be able to
keep from loving any companion they might
give her short of a monster. When Madame
de Tourzel expressed a hope that she might
be allowed to leave France, Madame Royale
answered sadly “that she still found some
comfort in dwelling in a country which held
the ashes of those who had been dearest to
her in the world.” And, she added with a
burst of tears, that “she would have been
much happier if she could have shared their
fate instead of being condemned to weep for
them.” No single expression of bitterness,
however, escaped from her.</p>

<p>The good Marquise was considerably
shocked at the freedom with which Madame
de Chantereine treated the princess, and the
airs of authority which she assumed over her.
The Marquise and her daughter endeavoured
to make her see this by the great respect which
they themselves showed Madame Royale, but
is was to no purpose. Madame Royale, however,
had attached herself to the lady, and did
not resent her familiarity. Any companion
who showed her kindness was welcome to her,
and Madame de Chantereine was an educated
person, could speak Italian, of which the
princess was fond, and gave her lessons in
embroidery, at which she was very skilful.</p>

<p>Madame Royale was allowed once more to
walk in the garden of the Temple. The
faithful Hué hired a room in a house overlooking
the garden, and ventured to sing in
her hearing a ballad which foretold that her
captivity would soon be over. More than
this, he contrived to have conveyed to the
princess a letter, with which he had been
entrusted by her uncle,
Louis XVIII., and to
obtain her reply. From
Madame de Tourzel
Madame Royale learnt
that it was the wish of
her uncle, as it had
been that of her parents,
that she should
wed her cousin, the
Duc d’Angoulême. It
was the first time she
had heard this, and
she expressed surprise
that her father and
mother had never
spoken to her on the
subject, but Madame
de Tourzel explained
that they had probably
refrained on account
of her youth,
and for fear of distracting
her attention
from her studies. The
thought of being able
to carry out what had
been her parents’
wish made a great impression
on the princess,
and with a fresh
interest thus awakened
she asked Madame de
Tourzel many questions respecting the Duke.</p>

<p>The discovery, however, of a supposed
Royalist plot, and, later on, the application
of the Tuscan Envoy to be allowed to salute
the princess, caused her to be again more
closely confined and debarred from the society
of her friends. But her captivity was now to
be only of short duration, and at the end of
November the following order opened the
gates of the Temple:—</p>

<p>“The Executive Directory resolve that the
Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Relations
are charged to take the measures necessary to
accelerate the exchange of the daughter of the
last King for the Citizens Camus, Quinette,
and other deputies or agents of the Republic;
to appoint a proper officer of the gendarmerie,
fit for the purpose, to accompany the daughter
of the last King as far as Basle; and to allow
her to take with her such persons engaged in
her education as she likes best.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="uppercase">t</span> the end of our
last article we
were speaking
of the Post
Office as a
banking establishment,
and we did not
finish all there
was to say on
the subject.</p>

<p>Being both
bankers and
letter-carriers,
the postal authorities
offer
unusual facilities
to the
public for sending money to different places,
either in the United Kingdom, or in the
colonies, or in foreign countries. This department
of their business is divided into two
branches—that dealing with <i>Money Orders</i>,
which are an old institution, and that occupied
with <i>Postal Orders</i>, which only came
into use in 1880.</p>

<p>Money orders were first started in 1792 by
three Post Office clerks, with the idea that
they would be of service for sending
small sums safely to soldiers and sailors. The
business gradually extended, and in 1838 was
taken over by the Government.</p>

<p>The charge for remitting was at first eightpence
in the pound; but it has been reduced
from time to time, the last reduction being
made only a few months ago. It now stands
as follows:—To remit to any place in the
United Kingdom any sum not exceeding a
pound costs 2d.; from one pound and not exceeding
two pounds costs 3d.; from two
pounds and not exceeding four pounds costs
4d.; from four pounds and not exceeding
seven pounds costs 5d.; and from seven
pounds to ten pounds you have to pay 6d.
No single order is issued for more than ten
pounds; but if you have to remit, say, thirty
pounds, it is an easy matter to get three
orders.</p>

<p>To get a money order, the first thing you
have to do is to fill up an “application form,”
to be had gratuitously at all money order
offices. All post offices, by the way, are not
money order offices. Here is a form filled
up:—</p>

<p class="ml4">
<span class="smcap">Money Order Required</span><br />
For £9 2s. 3d.<br />
Payable at <i>Pepperness</i>.<br />
To <i>Miss Flora Sprat</i>.<br />
Sent by <i>Esmeralda B. G. Constable.</i><br />
Residing at <i>Grumblethorpe</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The amount of the order required, along
with the commission—the total in this case
would be £9 2s. 9d.—is handed over with the
form to the postmaster, or whoever is acting
for him. No order may contain a fractional
part of a penny. To make an order more secure,
it may be “crossed,” just as we mentioned
could be done with cheques. In that
case it is payable only through a bank.</p>

<p>When a money order is to be paid in London,
or in any other town where there are
more money order offices than one, the sender
should say at what particular office she wishes
it to be paid. Should she not do so, and only
say, “Payable at London,” or “Manchester,”
or “Edinburgh,” the receiver of the order will
get payment at the head office in the town
only.</p>

<p>As a precaution against dishonest people,
it is recommended that when the sender of the
order is well known to the receiver, the letter
enclosing it should be signed with initials only.
When she is not well known, safety may be
given to the order by making it payable ten
days after date, or by having it crossed like a
cheque, or by registering the letter containing
it; or the name of the sender may be sent in
a separate letter from that containing the
money order. If ever you make a money
order payable ten days after date, you must
on obtaining it affix to it, in the presence of
the postmaster, a penny adhesive stamp, and
write your signature across the stamp.</p>

<p>When an order is presented for payment,
the person presenting it is asked “Who sent
this order?” and if this question is correctly
answered, and the order is properly receipted,
the sum is at once handed over, “unless the
postmaster have good reason for believing
that the applicant is neither the rightful
claimant, nor deputed by him or her.”</p>

<p>Money orders are not only to be obtained
for places in the United Kingdom. They are
also issued on France, Belgium, Switzerland,
Germany, Italy, Holland, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, the United States, and several other
foreign countries, and on most of the British
colonies and foreign possessions. The rates
of commission charged for these foreign money
orders are—For sums not exceeding two
pounds, 6d.; from two pounds to five pounds,
1s.; from five pounds to seven pounds, 1s. 6d.;
and from seven pounds to ten pounds, the
highest limit of a single order—2s. The regulations
affecting foreign money orders may
be seen in the useful Postal Guide, which is
published, as we mentioned in our first article,
once every quarter.</p>

<p>There has been a considerable falling-off
of recent years in the number of inland money
orders issued, colonial and foreign orders
having, however, on the other hand, increased
in number. The decrease has been brought
about by the introduction of postal orders, as
they are called, which have been found much
more convenient in some respects, not to
speak of their being, for small sums, decidedly
cheaper.</p>

<p>These postal orders, payable on presentation
without previous notice, are issued for fixed
sums from a shilling up to a pound, and are to
be obtained at all money order offices in the
United Kingdom, as well as at Malta,
Gibraltar, and Constantinople. Here are the
amounts for which they are issued, together
with the “poundage” payable on each order:
There are orders for 1s. and 1s. 6d., on which
the charge is ½d.; then there are orders for
2s., 2s. 6d., 3s., 3s. 6d., 4s., 4s. 6d., 5s., 7s. 6d.,
10s., and 10s. 6d., which cost 1d. each; and,
last of all, there are orders for 15s. and 20s.,
on which one has to pay 1½d. A postal order
is in the following form:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Postmaster in charge of the Money
Order Office at.....................</p>

<p>Pay to........................., at any time within
Three Calendar Months from the last day of
the month of issue, the sum of Ten Shillings,
on account of Her Majesty’s Postmaster-General.</p>
</div>

<p>When one has to remit broken amounts,
say 4s. 2½d., or 8s. 3d., or 10s. 9½d., postage
stamps may be affixed to the face of the
orders; but the stamps used in this way on
any one order must not exceed fivepence in
value.</p>

<p>Every postal order issued has this regulation
printed on it:—“The person to whom
this order is issued must, before parting with
it, fill in the name of the person to whom the
amount is to be paid, and may fill in the name
of the money order office at which the amount
is to be paid.” The word <i>must</i> is underlined
in the Postal Guide; but the public having
discovered that postal orders are a very convenient
form of small currency, have never taken
the regulation seriously. In fact, postal orders
are coming more and more to be passed from
hand to hand like coin, the blank spaces in
the order being only filled in when it comes to
the last holder.</p>

<p>When circulating in this way, however,
postal orders have an inconvenience: they
must be cashed within three calendar months
from the last day of the month when they
were issued, otherwise a sum equal in amount
to the original “poundage” is charged for
every additional three months that passes before
the order is presented for payment.
Suppose a postal order kept on circulating, it
would fall in value every three months. A
shilling postal order at the end of a year would
only be worth 10½d.; at the end of two years
its value would be 8½d.; and suppose it
remained uncashed for six years, all you would
get for it would be ½d.</p>

<p>Before a postal order is paid, the blank
spaces must be filled in, and the receiver of
the money must sign her name at the foot.
Should a postal order be “crossed” like a
cheque, payment will only be made through a
banker.</p>

<p>Leaving money and postal orders—which
we have spoken about fully because they are
such everyday documents—we come now to
speak of <i>Insurance</i>. And this is a subject
about which all prudent people should know
something.</p>

<p>The object for which insurance exists is to
guard against certain accidents to which we
are all liable, such as the destruction of property
by fire, or the loss of future earnings by
disablement or death. An agreement is
entered into by which one party, known as
the <i>insurer</i> or <i>assurer</i>, agrees to pay to
another, called the <i>insured</i> or <i>assured</i>, a
certain sum in the event of the particular
event insured against happening.</p>

<p>The document which states the conditions
of this agreement is called the <i>policy</i>, and the
payment made on account of the insurance is
known as the <i>premium</i>.</p>

<p>Insurance of houses and goods against fire
began in London in 1667, the year after the
Great Fire, in which the citizens had so
terrible an experience of the character of the
all-devouring element. The business has now
attained gigantic proportions, the insurance
companies of our own day being as a rule
very wealthy and profitable concerns.</p>

<p>The rates charged for insurance are calculated
at so much per cent.—or so much for
every hundred pounds—of the sum insured.
They vary in amount according to the nature
of the risk. If there is little danger under
ordinary circumstances—as in a dwelling-house—of
the property being destroyed by
fire, the sum to be paid is low; if, on the
other hand, the danger is considerable—as in
a sugar refinery—the charge is high.</p>

<p>Risks may be divided into three classes—common,
hazardous, and doubly hazardous.
Common insurances are charged 1s. 6d. to 2s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">{309}</span>
per cent. per annum, with certain exceptions;
hazardous insurances are charged 2s. 6d. to
3s. 6d. per cent. per annum, with certain
exceptions; and doubly hazardous insurances
are charged 4s. 6d. to 5s. per cent. per annum,
with certain exceptions; and in the case of
the exceptions the rate may run to 10s., 15s.,
or even more per cent.</p>

<p>In describing the property to be insured,
you must be careful to tell the whole truth
about it, so that the company may know what
risk they are running in insuring it. Suppose,
too, after the insurance has been effected the
risk should become greater—say by the
erection of a stove—you must not fail to keep
yourself safe by communicating with the company.
There are some kinds of property, such
as ready money, books of accounts (their value
as documents), bank-notes, stamps, bills,
bonds, and other written securities, which
insurance companies will not undertake to
insure on any terms.</p>

<p>Insurance premiums are usually paid once a
year at one or other of the four quarter-days.
Fifteen <i>days of grace</i> are allowed after the
expiry of annual policies, and if the premium
is not paid before the end of these fifteen
days, the insurance company holds itself free
from all risk. All policies, however, are not
annual ones. You may insure for any length
of time. No days of grace are allowed on
“short-time policies”—that is, on policies for
less than twelve months.</p>

<p>If one has any property to speak of, it is
always well to insure, for accidents will
happen. Perhaps, after paying for many
years without a disaster, one may be inclined
to lament having insured at all, and wish that
all the money paid in premiums were in her
own pocket; but this is not the right way of
looking at it. The money sunk in premiums is
well spent in buying ease of mind. A person
insured can sleep in comfort, knowing that
if fire should overtake her property she will
recover full value; whilst one uninsured may
pass many sleepless hours thinking, If I am
burned out, what will become of me?</p>

<p><i>Life Insurance</i> is quite as useful an institution
as insurance against fire; indeed, it has
been called “one of the greatest blessings of
modern times.” In it, by means of an annual
payment, varying according to the age of the
person whose life is insured, a sum is secured
in the event of death. A girl may not have
any necessity for benefiting survivors in this
way, but she should know something about
the matter for all that.</p>

<p>In insuring one’s life the applicant is
required to furnish information as to her own
health and habits of life, and some particulars
as to her family history. If the application
should be rejected on the ground of ill-health
or a tendency to hereditary disease, you must
just try elsewhere: offices are to be found
that will insure unsound lives, the charge
being, of course, proportioned to the risk.</p>

<p>The cost of life insurance is based on the
expectation of life at different ages. The
expectation of life, for example, of a girl of
ten years of age is about 48 years; at fifteen
about 44 years; at twenty about 40 years, and
so on, decreasing year by year, till at last it
dwindles down to nothing at all.</p>

<p>A period of grace, most commonly thirty
days, is allowed after each life premium falls
due. If it is not paid within that time, the
conclusion is come to that the policy-holder
intends to drop the contract.</p>

<p>It is a matter of great importance to be
insured in a good office, and the most careful
inquiry should be made on the subject before
taking out a policy. “Safety,” says one
writer, “ought to be the first consideration,
and economy the second; but really, economy
ought to be put first, for there is no economy
in insuring in an unsound office, however low
its premium may be.”</p>

<p>Life insurances on a small scale can be
effected better, perhaps, through the Post
Office than through any other channel. The
Postmaster-General is authorised by an Act
of Parliament to insure the lives of persons
of either sex. The lives of children under
eight years of age cannot be insured; from
eight to fourteen they can be insured for not
more than £5; and from fourteen to sixty-five
they can be insured for any amount not less
than £5 or more than £100. The security for
the payment of the money at the proper time
is the best in the world.</p>

<p>Forms of proposal for the insurance of
lives are to be obtained at any Post Office
Savings Bank, and anyone can see there the
tables of the premiums to be charged, and
obtain all other necessary particulars. As examples
of the various ways in which insurance
through the Post Office can be effected, take
the following:—The life of a girl between
fifteen and sixteen years old may be insured
for £10 by an annual payment through life of
3s. 10d., or by an annual payment to the age
of sixty of 4s., or by a single payment of
£3 17s. Or she can assure £10 at the age of
sixty years, after the payment of the final
premium, or at death, should death occur
before that age, by an annual payment of
4s. 6d., or by a single payment of £4 7s.</p>

<p>There are some companies which insure
lives by the payment of a small sum weekly or
fortnightly, a collector calling for the payments
when they become due. This is a dear
system; no more profitable than the purchase
of tea half an ounce at a time. In these days
of savings banks it is no excuse that it suits
scantily filled purses. Instead of adopting it,
it would be far better for their own interest if
people of small means would lodge the sums
they would otherwise have paid the collector
in the Post Office Savings Bank, and at the
end of the year direct that the amount be
applied to the payment of an insurance
premium.</p>

<p>Besides the two forms we have mentioned
there are other varieties of insurance. You
can insure plate glass against breakage, boilers
against bursting, and crops against hailstorms.
The lives of horses and cattle can be insured,
and pig insurance companies are not unknown.</p>

<p>Insurance against accidents is another
useful variety. It dates back from 1849,
when a company was started to insure against
the consequences of railway accidents. In
return for a payment of 3d., 2d. or 1d. made
by first, second, or third class passengers
respectively, for insurance during a single
journey, it undertook to pay £1,000, £500 or
£200 in case of death by such an accident, or
a certain weekly allowance in respect of
personal injury not resulting in death. A few
years later the business was extended, and
people can now insure against accidents of all
kinds by a yearly payment proportioned to
the degree of risk supposed to attach to
various occupations or other conditions of life.</p>

<p>There is another kind of insurance worth
knowing about: Fidelity Guarantee Insurance,
it is called. By means of it employers are
guaranteed against the dishonesty or
insolvency of their servants. Previously,
people in positions of trust often got others to
be surety for them, but the system of private
suretyship led to many hardships. Solomon
was right, and let all wise girls take note of it:
“He that is surety for a stranger shall smart
for it; and <i>he that hateth suretyship is sure</i>.”
The guarantee of a company, given as a pure
matter of business, and for an annual payment,
is now generally preferred. Of course, before
giving a guarantee the company makes very
particular inquiry regarding the character of
the person and the checks to be used by
the employer. Some companies insure only
against embezzlement, whilst others protect
the employer against any failure to make good
the sums entrusted to the <i>employé</i>. The
premiums to be paid annually range from 10s.
to 60s. per cent. of the sum guaranteed.</p>

<p><i>Annuities</i> are our next subject. An annuity
is a periodical payment made either for a fixed
number of years or whilst a given life lasts.
It may be paid yearly, quarterly, weekly, or
otherwise. It may come to one as a gift, or
be left as a legacy, but it can also be purchased
through an insurance company by the payment
of a certain sum of money supposed to be its
equivalent in value. Annuities bought in this
way may be either <i>immediate</i>—that is to say,
the payment of them beginning at once—or
<i>deferred</i>; in other words, the enjoyment of
them postponed till after a certain number of
years have elapsed. If, say, £100 is to be received
each year by anyone, he or she is said
to have “an annuity of £100.”</p>

<p>For young people, with all the chances of
life before them, the purchase of an annuity is
seldom wise. The sum, observe, sunk in this
way can never be had back again, even though
an opportunity should occur for making a
much more profitable use of it. But when
people grow up, it is often the best way to
make the most of a small capital, and to prevent
their becoming, perhaps, a little later in
life, a burden on their friends. The great
thing, in settling whether to invest money
thus, is to discuss the matter with common
sense, and to ask, “What should I do, so as
to be most useful to myself and to others?”</p>

<p>Annuities, both immediate and deferred,
are granted by the Post Office for any amount
not less than £1 or more than £100 to any
person not under the age of five years. Forms
of proposal for purchasing them are to be had
at any Post Office Savings Bank. The sum
charged varies with the age and sex of the
person on whose life the annuity is to depend,
and, in the case of deferred annuities, with
the number of years which are to elapse before
the commencement of the annuity.</p>

<p>The payment of a deferred annuity may be
made in one sum, or it may be broken up into
a number of small payments at regular intervals.
You can, by a slight increase on the
payment for a deferred annuity, secure the
return of the purchase-money to your representatives
in the event of your death before
the commencement of the annuity, or to yourself,
should you for any reason wish to be out
of the bargain.</p>

<p>A word of advice is given by a sensible
writer to all who are life annuitants. “They
should bear in mind,” she says, “to live well
within their income, as generally the whole of
their money is one of <i>life interest</i>, and there
will be no fund to fall back upon to pay
funeral expenses, doctors’ bills, wages, etc.,
when they die, but their savings.”</p>

<p>Fire insurance, life insurance, and the
purchase of annuities are amongst the sensible
transactions of prudent and saving people.
But sometimes the prudent and saving, quite
through innocent misfortune, come down in
the world, and have a difficulty in making
both ends meet for the present, let alone
providing for the future. Under these
circumstances people without much experience,
and especially women who are not business
women, are very apt to fall a prey to the
wiles of the professional money-lender. To
the artful ways of the money-lending fraternity
we shall devote what remains of this article.</p>

<p>If anyone is in want of a little ready money
she has only to turn over the morning papers,
and she will there see a score of advertisements
headed “Money,” and all offering “loans on
easy terms.” How is she to know, unless she
has been told, that these petty money-lenders
are one of the most serious evils of our present
state of society, and that there are hundreds of
them preying on the ignorance, the impulsiveness,
and the necessities of their fellow-creatures?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">{310}</span></p>

<p>“There is considerable variety,” says a
writer in the <i>Leisure Hour</i>, “in the bait used
by these angling money-lenders, but great
sameness in the general form of the cruel hook
by which poor silly fish are caught. Some of
the advertisements are from ‘loan offices,’
others from ‘private gentlemen’ who are
‘willing to advance money’ and who have
‘no connection with loan offices.’ They all
seem to have unlimited resources, from £2 to
£1,000 being at the disposal of every
borrower. The invitations are to respectable
persons, male or female, in town or country;
distance no object; personal application
preferred, but not necessary. ‘Strict secrecy
and prompt despatch’ are usually promised;
answers to application ‘by return of post’
and money sent ‘at a day’s notice.’ So
obliging are these gentlemen, ‘forms will be
sent <i>gratis</i>,’ and in some cases the borrower is
assured there are ‘no law costs’ and ‘no
office fees.’ More convenient still there are
‘no securities required.’ To borrow is an
easy matter after all.</p>

<p>“But of course there must be securities of
some sort. Well, the borrower’s ‘note of
hand’ is sufficient, with deposit of deeds,
leases, life policies, or, if preferred, a bill of
sale on furniture or other goods ‘without
removal’ (<i>i.e.</i> at the time of borrowing). Then
the repayment may be by ‘easy instalments.’”
How accommodating!</p>

<p>Many of these assertions the needy borrower
will find abundant reason to doubt before the
loan is completed. On application she will
be puzzled to reconcile the terms named to
her with those in the alluring advertisement,
and will find the rate of interest to be
truly “five per cent. and upwards,” fifty per
cent. being no uncommon demand, in addition
to expenses connected with and deducted from
the loan. Should she complain about the
expenses, she is usually told that they are
rendered necessary by the existence of some
special risk in her particular case.</p>

<p>The writer whom we have just quoted tells
a sad story of a poor widow lady, who, being
pressed for her rent, saw a money-lender’s
advertisement and answered it. The money-lender
came, and obtained the lease of the
house as a security, “only a form, you know.”
He was such a polite, kind man; and interest,
she understood, was to be only £5 per cent.</p>

<p>Soon after the widow had an offer for her
house and furniture, so she went to redeem
the lease held in security by the money-lender.
The poor woman, who had signed the papers
presented to her, either without reading them
or without thoroughly understanding them,
then learned for the first time that “£5 per
cent.” did not mean £5 a year for the loan
of a hundred pounds. The money-lender’s
advertisement did not say “£5 per cent. per
annum.” He lent his money at £5 per cent.
per month, or £60 for a year for £100,
besides various fees and charges. The moral
of the story is that it is very foolish to have
anything to do with money-lenders, and that
it is still more foolish to go into any transaction
without making perfectly certain as to the
exact amount for which one is liable.</p>

<p>There are some money-lenders who only
pretend to lend: as a matter of fact, they
never do. Their profits are derived solely
from booking fees, office expenses, and
charges for the sham “inquiry,” which
always is of so unsatisfactory a nature that
the loan cannot be granted. It is true the
advertisements of these gentry often state that
no preliminary fees or office expenses of any
kind are charged. The borrower, however, is
in such cases informed that these payments
are dispensed with only in the cases of certain
classes, in none of which, we need hardly say
is she fortunate enough to find herself.</p>

August, John
and Charlie got
home before Mr.

over now, and
consequently they were not detained so
late as they had been for the last month.
Both the shepherd and his son were
astonished to see this grand French
gentleman seated on a little wooden
stool at Fairy’s feet, quite at home, and
apparently on intimate terms with her
and Mrs. Shelley, for they were all three
laughing merrily at Mrs. Shelley’s attempts
at French when the shepherds
arrived.</p>

<p>“Why, here is John! This is my
friend, Mr. de Courcy—Mr. de Courcy,
this is John, and this is my foster-brother,”
said Fairy, inwardly feeling
very much ashamed of the latter, who,
to her annoyance, only pulled his forelock,
and was too shy to say a word.</p>

<p>Rex jumped up, no less astonished at
the apparition of these two shepherds in
their smock frocks, with their crooks in
their hands, than they were at the sight
of him, and then, having executed one
or two of his French bows, he entered
into a conversation with John Shelley
about his sheep as easily as he would
have discussed art or literature with
people in his own rank of life.</p>

<p>And if Fairy felt ashamed of Charlie
with his clump shoes, his dirty hands,
his Sussex brogue, and his uncouth,
clownish manners, she was rather proud
than otherwise of John Shelley, who,
with his hat in his hand, stood there
with a gentle dignity all his own, talking
simply of his sheep, with an honest pride
in his position as head shepherd of the
largest sheep-farmer in the district that
was as naive as it was touching.</p>

<p>But as Rex walked back to Oafham
that evening it was with a weight on
his mind that he saw no chance of removing.
Hitherto he had only pictured
to himself an ideal pastoral shepherd as
Fairy’s foster-father, and though John
Shelley might have sat to an artist as a
patriarchal shepherd, there was nothing
ideal or poetical about Charlie: a more
realistic clod-hopping youth it would be
hard to meet with, even in the South
Downs. And this was Fairy’s foster-brother!
Just imagine his mother’s face
or Lady Oafham’s if they were introduced
to Charlie as the foster-brother
of Rex’s future wife. Such a thought
was so appalling that it actually prevented
Rex from paying his accustomed
visit the next day, though he was miserable,
and so afraid he might have offended
Fairy by his absence, that after
a sleepless night and a very impatient
morning, he presented himself at the
shepherd’s house the next day as usual.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come yesterday?”
were Fairy’s first words.</p>

<p>“My dear Fairy, we can’t expect Mr.
de Courcy to honour us with a visit every
day,” said Mrs. Shelley, reprovingly.</p>

<p>“Did you miss me? If I only dared
to think you did!” said Rex, in French.</p>

<p>“Never mind that; I want to know
why you did not come yesterday. Come,
confess my foster-brother frightened you
away now, didn’t he?” said Fairy, in
the same language.</p>

<p>And Rex, bargaining first for absolution,
made a full confession of his fault,
and, in spite of Mrs. Shelley’s presence,
would have gone on, under cover of a
foreign language, to confess his love
too, if the arrival of John Shelley had
not stopped him. The shepherd looked
grave when he saw Mr. de Courcy, but
Rex made himself so pleasant and agreeable
that the frown vanished from his
face, and it was only after Rex had left
that he resumed his grave look.</p>

<p>The shepherd was very silent during
supper, and Mrs. Shelley was not wrong
in her conjecture that there was a marital
lecture in store for her when Fairy
was gone to bed and they were alone.</p>

<p>“Polly,” said the shepherd, suddenly,
as Fairy’s door closed, “how long has
this been going on?”</p>

<p>“Has what been going on?” returned
Mrs. Shelley, knowing well enough all
the while what her husband meant.</p>

<p>“How long have you been deceiving
me and allowing that young gentleman
to steal my poor little Fairy’s heart?”
said John, sternly.</p>

<p>“I never deceived you in my life,
John Shelley. How dare you say such
a thing?” retorted Mrs. Shelley,
warmly.</p>

<p>“Polly, it is no use being angry about
it; you have done wrong, and you know
it as well as I. From what I saw the
other day and to-day it is very clear
this gentleman has been coming here
pretty often, and you kept it from me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">{311}</span>
knowing well enough I should have put
a stop to it, had I known it, long ago,
as I shall do now, though I misdoubt
me but the mischief is done already, for
I am afraid Fairy has lost her heart.”</p>

<p>“And pray why should you want to
put a stop to it? Why should not Fairy
marry Mr. de Courcy if they care for
each other?” asked Mrs. Shelley,
anxious to divert John’s attention from
her offence.</p>

<p>“For two excellent reasons. First, we
know nothing at all about him; pleasant
as he appears, he may be a scamp for
aught we know; and in the next place,
supposing he is all he appears, it is
quite certain neither Lady Oafham nor
his own parents would hear of his marrying
the foster-child of a poor shepherd.”</p>

<p>“Mr. de Courcy a scamp! I am as
certain he is all he seems to be as I am
that you are an honest man, and for all
we know Fairy may be as well-born as
he is; and as for your stopping it, you
will have a hard task to do that, I am
sure.”</p>

<p>“Hard or not, I shall do it, and at
once,” said John, decidedly, and Mrs.
Shelley saw he was too vexed to be persuaded
not to take the matter in his own
hands, and, conscious as she was that he
was right and that she had acted foolishly,
though she was too proud to
acknowledge it, she now thought it
wiser to say no more about it, though
she was intensely curious to know what
he would do.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Fairy came
back from the rectory to dinner, which
these two generally ate alone, John and
Charlie taking theirs with them, for
they went as far as five or six miles from
home with their flocks, Mrs. Shelley
thought it better to warn Fairy of what
was in store for her before Mr. de
Courcy made his appearance that afternoon,
as in the ordinary course of things
he was sure to do; so, waiting till Fairy
had finished her dinner, lest her news
should destroy the girl’s appetite, small
enough at all times in Mrs. Shelley’s
opinion, she said, “Fairy, John is very
angry with me for letting Mr. de Courcy
come here so often. He told me of it
last night after you were gone to bed,
and he has not opened his lips to me
since.”</p>

<p>“John angry! Why should he be
angry, mother? I thought he liked Mr.
de Courcy. Perhaps some more sheep
have died, and he is only grieving for
them. You have made a mistake; he
can’t be angry about me.”</p>

<p>“But he is, though. What is more,
he is going to put a stop to Mr. de
Courcy coming here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but mother, he can’t do that.
I shall tell Rex—I mean Mr. de Courcy—I
wish him to come, and he just won’t
pay any attention to John. He will come
all the same, I am sure,” said Fairy,
not at all alarmed by John’s threat.</p>

<p>“I doubt it, Fairy. You have always
done as you liked with John up to now,
but now he has taken it into his head it
is his duty to stop these visits, he will
do it; even you won’t be able to stop
him. And if Mr. de Courcy should
come this afternoon, you had better tell
him John won’t allow him to come to
this house, because he is certain his relations
would not approve of it if they
knew. And, Fairy, take my advice,
and tell him to-day, for I am half afraid
it will be the last time you will see
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” exclaimed Fairy,
turning so pale that Mrs. Shelley saw at
a glance the mischief was done, and that
if John put his threat into execution,
and she was certain he would, it would
go very near to breaking poor little
Fairy’s heart, except hearts, in Mrs.
Shelley’s opinion, were very hard things
and took a deal of breaking.</p>

<p>“Well, well, child, tell Mr. de Courcy,
and see what he says, but I am as sure
as I am standing here John will keep
his word, if he has not done so already.”</p>

<p>“Already! Oh, mother, Rex must
come this afternoon; I am certain he
would never stop away without telling
me, for all the Johns in the world,” said
Fairy; but in spite of her words she was
terribly afraid lest he should not come,
and spent the afternoon till nearly four
o’clock, in watching alternately the
road and the clock, until, at last, to
Mrs. Shelley’s delight no less than
Fairy’s, Rex’s step was heard.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate coincidence for Mr.
de Courcy and Fairy that Mrs. Shelley,
who always spent the afternoon with
them, was so occupied, according to her
own account, with some work indoors,
which could not possibly be postponed,
that she had only time to come to the
door once or twice and peep out at them.
The first time she came they were sitting
side by side on the bench. Mr. de Courcy
had his back to Mrs. Shelley, but, from
the eager way in which he was bending
towards Fairy, who was looking on the
ground with a happy smile on her bright
little face, Mrs. Shelley thought it would
be a pity to interrupt them. The next
time she looked out, which was half an
hour later, the bench was empty, but,
looking across the field, she saw the
lovers sauntering along arm-in-arm as
happily as if the whole world was made
for them, and there were no such thing
as angry parents or guardians to break
in and destroy their happiness.</p>

<p>“Poor young things! I have not the
heart to call them back, though I suppose
John would say I ought. I’ll let
them be; they may as well be happy for
one day at any rate; their game is almost
played out, I doubt,” said Mrs.
Shelley, watching them as they strolled
slowly along, regardless of the hot afternoon
sun, still high in the heavens.</p>

<p>The next time Mrs. Shelley looked it
was past six, and time John and Charlie
were in to supper, though neither of
them had yet appeared; and when she
went to the door to see if they were
coming, there was no one to be seen but
Fairy leaning on the gate and straining
her eyes and waving one of her little
hands in the direction of Oafham.</p>

<p>“Fairy, are John and Charlie coming?
It is almost supper-time,” called out
Mrs. Shelley, who, truth to tell, was not
a little curious as to what had passed
between Fairy and Mr. de Courcy, a
curiosity which was soon to be gratified,
for Fairy came running towards her.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother! I am so
happy; Rex loves me, and I am going
to be his wife some day.”</p>

<p>And as she spoke, Fairy threw herself
into Mrs. Shelley’s motherly arms.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Shortly</span> after the visit to Düsseldorf her
mother was requested to bring about a meeting
between her daughter and the Prince of
Roumania, Prince Charles of Hohenzollern.
The Princess Elizabeth was very anxious to
attend a concert to be given in Cologne in
October, at which Clara Schumann was to take
part. It was arranged that they should go to
Cologne for the purpose, and that the meeting
with the Prince, who was then in Paris, should
take place there. They put up at the Hotel
du Nord. Hours passed, and the Prince did
not appear. The ladies went into the flower
garden to dine. The dinner came to an end,
and Princess Elizabeth had not noticed that
she had been narrowly watched for a considerable
time by a group of gentlemen. One
of them stepped forward and introduced himself
to her mother as the Prince of Roumania.
Princess Elizabeth, ignorant of the fact that
the meeting had been pre-arranged, stretched
out both her hands to him with unfeigned
pleasure, and said, “I am so glad that we have
met here accidentally.” For several hours
they remained together among the flowers, and
in the Zoological Gardens, in animated conversation.</p>

<p>On her return to the hotel she exclaimed
enthusiastically, “What a charming man he
has become!” While she was dressing for
the concert the Prince spoke to her mother,
and asked her consent to the marriage. Princess
Elizabeth, however, was only thinking of
enjoying the music, and was beside herself
with impatience on account of the delay
caused by the Prince. When he left, the
young Princess burst out of her room into the
saloon, exclaiming, “But, mamma!” As if
terrified she stopped at the threshold, when
she saw the grave and agitated expression on
the countenance of her mother, who ran forward,
and threw her arms round her daughter’s
neck, and said, “My child, the Prince of
Roumania has asked your hand.” The astonishment
of the daughter was great, but it
became clear to her at once that, unconsciously
to herself, her heart had been quite won by
him.</p>

<p>When her mother asked her whether she
would like to take time for consideration, she
answered simply and decidedly, “Just let him
come; I shall love him very much.” And
when the Prince came and saluted her as his
betrothed, she said to him in soft and winning
tones, “It makes me so proud, and at
the same time so humble.” That same night
the Prince had to return to Paris. The entry
in her diary on the 12th of October is, “I
am engaged, and a happy bride.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The public
betrothal took place at Neuwied, on the 16th
of October, and on the 15th of November
they were married.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth had, previously to the
appearance of Prince Charles as a suitor, rejected
every proposal of marriage, but when,
long before her engagement to him, her
friends made plans for her, and wished that
there might be a throne in store for her, she
would jestingly reply, “The only throne that
could have any attractions for me is the Roumanian,
for there I should have something to
do.” That this was no mere idle expression of a
passing feeling is proved by her whole life and
work in her new home. She has become in
heart and life a Roumanian, and devoted herself
with all her powers to the well being of
her subjects. A wide and quite uncultivated
field of work lay before her. The first thing
to do was to make herself acquainted with it.
She felt that for this purpose something more
than crowded receptions was necessary,
and she arranged to receive the ladies who
were announced for presentation at Court
singly. “It was too disagreeable,” she said,
“to say what I did not really feel at receptions.
In order to avoid a falsehood I took
pains to feel the interest which I showed.
Everyone needs sympathy. Now everybody
interests me, and I find them all to be interesting.
The receptions do not bore me any
longer. On the contrary, I delight in them.
One must do thoroughly whatever one does,
if it is to succeed; one must be thorough if
one would be anything.”</p>

<p>On the 8th of September, 1870, a daughter
was born, who received the name of Maria at
her baptism. The child was enthusiastically
welcomed by the people, who said, “God
bless the new citizen of Roumania! May she
grow and prosper in the joy of her parents,
and the welfare of her country!” Henceforth
the infant daughter became the most important
personage in Roumania.</p>

<p>The Princess Elizabeth studied the language
with zeal, and acquired a perfect mastery of
it. The Roumanians say, with a dash of
pride, that she speaks it better than they do
themselves, for she constructs her sentences
with peculiar elegance.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp56" id="i_313" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_313.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“WAKING WOODS.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the year 1871 a club for the poor was
founded by her, and soon after a society for
the translation of children’s books. “There
are absolutely no Roumanian school books,
nor any for the people,” she wrote to her
mother; “I will provide these. I have already
distributed my best French books among the
young ladies, and also interested several
gentlemen in the work. The poet Alexandri
will criticise and correct: then they will be
quickly and cheaply printed. The language
will in this way become in some measure fixed,
and the young people, who cannot speak their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">{314}</span>
own language decently, will learn it quite
splendidly.” Her ideas were eagerly received
by the people, and interested them more even
than politics. In 1871 the Prince and Princess
made a journey through Moldavia to Jassy, in
order to become acquainted with that part of
their dominions. It was a triumphal progress
all the way. Their reception everywhere was
alike brilliant and hearty. At Jassy their
time was filled up with receptions, visits to
churches and schools, etc.</p>

<p>Their summers are passed in the Carpathian
Mountains, 2,900 feet above the sea.
Their first residence was an old monastery
called Sinaia; now it is Castle Pelesch, which
the Prince has built. Distinguished people
of all sorts—<i>savans</i>, artists, musicians—are
received in this retreat, and are often entertained
there for weeks together. Society of
this kind is the great enjoyment of the Prince
and Princess. In order to encourage native
industry, the Court wears the native national
costume while resident in the mountains.</p>

<p>In the ladies of her Court the Princess takes
a truly motherly interest. She loves particularly
to gather young people around her.
Several young women are invited to stay some
weeks every year at Sinaia, in order to share
in the working life of the Princess.</p>

<p>In 1874 time of severe trial came to Prince
Charles and his wife. Their child, Princess
Maria, who was as lovely and as marked in
her individuality as her mother, took ill of
diphtheria, and died in the lap of her English
nurse. Her last words were in English: “All
is finished.” Up to the very last the Princess
could not believe that the end was so near;
but when the certainty of the fact was realised
with overwhelming force, she bowed her head
with humble submission to the will of God.
“God,” she said, “has loved my child more than
I have, therefore He has taken her to Himself.
Thank God that He ever gave her to me!”</p>

<p>To her mother she wrote:—</p>

<p>“I often say that a mother’s love is stronger
than the grave, and I rejoice in my child’s
blessedness. But that earth appears darker
to me in consequence cannot be altered. It
must be endured.”</p>

<p>Her poems furnish abundant evidence of
her estimate of a mother’s love, and of her
love and grief for the loss of her child.</p>

<p>When she first went to Roumania, no one
suspected that Princess Elizabeth was a
poetess. Once, when the poet Alexandri was
in attendance in Bucharest, she said to him
with deep blushes, “I wish to make a confession
to you, but I have not the courage.”
After a long pause, she said bashfully, with a
soft voice, “I, too, write poems.” At Alexandri’s
request, she showed him some of them.
He saw at once that she had poetical gifts,
and encouraged her to go forward. He sent
her a thick volume of his manuscripts, and
she began to translate popular Roumanian
legends into German. In the work of translation
she learnt practically much of the “art
of poetry.” She had written poetry hitherto
just as a bird sings. Rhymes and verses
came more readily to her than prose. It was
in her great sorrow for the death of her
daughter that she betook herself to translation.
She needed to occupy her mind by
strenuous work. This she found in translation.
She not only translated Roumanian
works into German, but also the treasures of
German literature into Roumanian. In this
way she thought she could render the greatest
service to her subjects. The effect of such
work upon her mind she describes to her
mother thus:—“When I am not actually
asleep, neither my head nor hands rest for a
second; otherwise it fares ill with me. Constant
activity keeps the mind fresh, and sometimes
only am I overcome when I remember
my beloved one.”</p>

<p>She naturally felt a great longing to see her
mother once more. It was arranged for
them to meet at Cologne, and from thence to
proceed to St. Leonards for a few weeks.
She was much impressed by London. They
paid a visit to Oxford, where they were Max
Müller’s guests for two days. It was here
that she presented to her mother a book in
missal form, called “My Journey Through the
World; containing Rhymes and Versicles
Confided to the Heart of My Mother.” Charles
Kingsley was present when she astonished
her mother by handing this volume to her,
and was much touched by one of the poems
pointed out to him, of which the following is
a rough but faithful rendering. It is called</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The book contained poems from the time of
her confirmation till her thirtieth year.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Turkish War in 1877
Roumania was drawn into the conflict. One
of the results was that the independence of
Roumania was declared. The principality became
a kingdom, and Prince Charles and Princess
Elizabeth were crowned King and Queen.
During the war the Princess set a noble example
of what her biographer describes as “the
inborn deaconess-calling of every woman.”
The throne-room was converted into a workroom,
where, under her immediate superintendence,
linen and bandages were prepared.
Women of all ranks and nationalities went
in and out, and vied with each other in providing
things for the army in the field. Out
of her own means the Princess furnished a
barrack hospital of a hundred beds, which she
looked after herself. She extended her activity
to all the other hospitals also that were
organised. She ministered to all the wounded
that were brought from the battle-field. Day
and night she sought to comfort and encourage
them. To many a dying man she spoke
the last words of consolation; many received
from her hand the pain-deadening chloroform.
She induced many to submit to have limbs
amputated. The Roumanian soldier prefers
death to amputation. “Better die than be
a beggar man,” he says. To one young soldier
she pointed out that he had a long life
before him, and ought to submit to the operation.
“For love of you, Regina,” he sighed.
She exercised a great moral influence over the
suffering. Among the people she was called
“The mother of the wounded.” Her strength
seemed to be doubled in times of danger,
when the claims upon her services were the
greatest. She was always collected, and never
lost her presence of mind, whatever agitation
and despondency prevailed around her. When,
in her anxiety about her husband and the army,
she could only sleep for two or three hours,
she would seek to divert her mind with music
and poetry half the night, and at four in the
morning she would walk up and down, and
mentally arrange the work of the ensuing day.
During the war she founded a sisterhood, defraying
the expenses out of her own pocket.
At first there were only two sisters, but in
1884 the number had increased to twenty. In
hospitals and private houses they give their
services for five francs a day, and are much in
demand. Rich people often pay more, and
thus the sisters can attend to the poor gratuitously.
Other useful societies owe their
origin to the Queen. As might have been
expected, the moral and physical strain of the
war time severely tried her. She has been
subject to repeated attacks of fever. At the
beginning of 1883 she had a dangerous illness,
which excited the fears and sympathies of the
whole Roumanian people. Her patience,
gentleness, and consideration for all around
her were very touching. She was saved by
means of a successful operation. The King
took her to Italy, and from thence to Neuwied.
When they returned to Roumania,
Castle Pelesch was near completion. In
October, 1883, it was solemnly dedicated, in
presence of all the high officials of the nation.</p>

<p>It is not many years ago since her poems
became widely known. The Queen herself
would never have thought of publishing them,
had not numberless copies passed into various
hands. Then she thought that “if they are
worth the tiresome labour of copying, so are
they of being printed.”</p>

<p>One of her most important volumes of
poetry, if not the most important, of which a
new edition has lately appeared, is called after
the seat of her family, which has several times
been mentioned in the course of this sketch,
“Meine Ruh” (Mon Repos). It contains ballads
and lyrical poems.</p>

<p>Some of the deepest questions that can
occupy the human mind have been treated by
her in other volumes.</p>

<p>Still in middle age, she carries forward her
beneficent work, and we may hope in due
time (far distant may the day be!) that the
public may have the opportunity of reading
the completed story of her life, which has
been so well told in the volume from which
we have derived all our information concerning
her. The Baroness von Stachelberg is
hardly guilty of any exaggeration when she
says that “as woman, as Princess, as Queen,
Carmen Sylva is one of the noblest and most
remarkable of her sex.”</p>

THE IGNORANT HOUSEKEEPER, AND HOW SHE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE.</h2>

<p><span class="uppercase">lla</span> was, unfortunately
for herself,
very timid at nights;
and even when at
home had always
been ready to
imagine burglars
and alarms of fire;
and Kate had often
laughed at her, and
asked what she
would do if, in her nightly searches round
her bedroom, she should find a burglar
under the bed, or hidden amongst the dresses
secreted in her wardrobe.</p>

<p>As she had always been thus ready to take
alarm on the smallest provocation, it is not to
be wondered at that the old gardener’s
mysterious warning filled her with anxiety;
the more so that, in spite of all her efforts to
persuade him, he resolutely refused to say
anything more, and she was left in a state of
hopeless bewilderment as to what his strange
hints could mean.</p>

<p>The only thing she could do was to be
specially watchful, and she determined that,
in spite of her fears, she would sit up at night
till the servants had gone to bed, and make
sure that everything was properly secured.</p>

<p>It was very evident that they did not like
it, and they did their utmost to compel her to
go to bed first, by sitting up till very late
themselves. But Ella had a determination of
character which caused her, when once she
was sure it was her duty to do anything, to
persist in carrying out her intention in spite
of all obstacles, and the servants’ objection to
her sitting up last at night made her only the
more determined to do so.</p>

<p>One night they had tried her patience
sorely by lingering about, but when they had
at last departed, Ella went her usual round,
and found they had carelessly left a side door
unfastened.</p>

<p>Having locked the door she went up to
bed, and, in spite of feeling nervous and
uneasy, she soon fell asleep, but only to be
awakened a short time after by a stealthy
sound in the room below.</p>

<p>She sat up and listened; it was true at last—there
was certainly someone getting into the
house.</p>

<p>What should she do? Should she cry for
help, or follow her first instinct to bury her
head under the bed-clothes? But her better
judgment prevailed; and remembering that her
aunt was often restless in the night, and that
it was probably only nurse who had gone
downstairs to get something for her, she
slipped on her dressing-gown and the warm
slippers Kate had provided her with, and
crept quietly out of the room and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Her heart beat so fast that, to her ears, it
drowned all other sounds, and it seemed
to her almost that it must alarm the
thieves. When she reached the hall she
found her fears verified: a light gleamed under
the dining-room door, and she heard voices
whispering inside.</p>

<p>She thought of calling the dogs, but dared
not risk alarming her aunt; so at last, summoning
up all her resolution, she opened the door,
and to her amazement found the table laid for
supper, and a party seated round it, consisting
of the two servants and two men.</p>

<p>The men instantly disappeared through the
open window, without waiting to see who had
interrupted them, leaving Ella alone with the
two angry but frightened servants. The
cellarette, which Ella was sure she had locked
before going to bed, was standing open, and
the contents were on the table. The cook’s
face was flushed, and she had evidently been
drinking a good deal.</p>

<p>Ella was so startled that she was quite
silent for a few minutes, and the cook
recovering herself first, began pouring out a
torrent of abuse; when, to Ella’s intense
relief, the door again opened, and Nurse
entered, while at the same moment two dark
figures appeared, clambering in through the
open window. Annie, the housemaid,
thinking them the same two who had just
escaped, rushed towards them, but to her
dismay found herself seized by a stalwart
policeman, and old Mr. Dudley came to Ella’s
side, begging her not to be frightened.</p>

<p>With this reinforcement Ella felt herself
victorious, and soon regained her self-possession
sufficiently to consider what was to
be done. The policeman assured her that she
had a perfect right to turn the two maids out
at once, but her own good sense, even without
Nurse’s advice, showed her that it would be
wrong to turn out two young women late
at night, however badly they might have
behaved. Accordingly, acting on Mr.
Dudley’s advice, she told them to go to their
bedroom at once, and prepare to leave first
thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Dudley accounted for his unexpected
appearance by explaining to Ella that he had
been sitting up late reading, and on looking
out of his window before going to bed, he had
noticed the two men lurking about, and
having several times suspected that something
was wrong, he had gone for a policeman,
hoping to be in time to catch the thieves.</p>

<p>To Ella’s great relief Mrs. Wilson was at
last convinced that the servants were untrustworthy,
and made no objection when she
heard that they had both left the house, with
their boxes, immediately after breakfast next
morning.</p>

<p>A respectable charwoman, recommended by
Mrs. Mobberly, was engaged to do the work
temporarily; and Ella, very much dismayed at
such an unexpected responsibility, had to consider
what steps must be taken to engage new
servants.</p>

<p>To begin with, Mrs. Mobberly advised her
to mention the matter to the tradespeople,
who often hear of good servants, and at the
same time she would herself go for Ella to a
registry office in the town, which she knew to
be thoroughly respectable. At the same time
she gave Ella a very solemn warning against
ever going to any registry office about which
she knew nothing, as some so-called offices
are places to be scrupulously avoided, both
by mistresses and servants.</p>

<p>The result of this vigorous action was that
Ella was besieged and overwhelmed by the
number of applicants for the situations. Mrs.
Wilson’s was a well-known place, where the
work was easy, and the rule in most respects
very light; and in addition to the respectable
and pleasant-looking young women who
came, Ella had to run the gauntlet of
incompetent girls, impudent girls, girls who
amazed her with the elegance of their
attire, and others who disgusted her
with their dirty slovenliness, not to
mention all the middle-aged women in
search of a comfortable home, and mothers
anxious to secure a good place for their young
daughters.</p>

<p>A good many of them were so evidently
unsuitable that Ella soon disposed of them,
and easily reduced the number to three or four
applicants, who, however, all seemed equally
suitable, and she felt so incapable of deciding
between these, that she dismissed them all for
the present, promising to write to each of the
selected number the next day.</p>

<p>So far the task, though rather overwhelming
for so inexperienced a housekeeper, had
been comparatively simple, for Ella had been
coached up beforehand, both by her aunt and
Mrs. Mobberly, as to the most important
questions to ask each applicant:—what had
been her last situation, and why she left it;
what wages she asked, where her home was,
whether she belonged to any church, and
whether she would be obliging and willing to
undertake the rather miscellaneous duties,
which included feeding the various animals,
and occasionally helping to water or weed
the garden, in addition to waiting on Mrs.
Wilson, and the usual house-work. Ella was
especially advised to explain the varied nature
of their duties to any likely applicants, that
there might be no misunderstanding about it
afterwards. But the task of finally selecting
the two best was rather more than Ella felt
equal to; so, as usual, she consulted Mrs.
Mobberly, who, feeling that Mrs. Wilson was
not likely ever to be very robust again, and
that it would therefore not be wise to have
only young girls in the house, when Nurse
should have left, advised Ella, if her aunt consented,
to engage as cook a middle-aged
widow, in whose son (a sailor) Mrs. Wilson
took great interest, and whom she had known
for several years as a respectable woman.</p>

<p>“I liked her very much directly I saw her,”
said Ella, “but I was afraid she would not be
so active and brisk about her work as a
younger woman.”</p>

<p>“Very likely not, but with such a small
household she can easily manage all she will
have to do; and even if you should
occasionally be obliged to have a charwoman
for extra cleaning, it would be quite worth
your while to do it, for the sake of the comfort
of having an experienced woman in the house,
whom you could depend upon to take care of
your aunt, and who would know what to do
in case of sudden illness.”</p>

<p>Then having, from Ella’s description,
decided which of the young girls seemed most
likely to suit, Mrs. Mobberly directed her to
write to the girl who was still at her situation,
and tell her to ask her mistress if she would
kindly appoint a time when it would be
convenient for Ella to call upon her about the
girl’s character.</p>

<p>“Some ladies prefer to write direct to the
mistress about a time to call,” Mrs. Mobberly
explained, “but I always think if the girl is
still in the situation it saves her mistress
trouble if she can take a message.”</p>

<p>Ella felt very nervous at this part of her task,
but carefully concealed her feelings from her
aunt, from whom she knew she would get no
sympathy, but only sarcastic remarks as to
how, in her young days, people were
more plainspoken, and called nervousness
and shyness by their proper names of conceit
and affectation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">{316}</span></p>

<p>Ella found the visit, when the time came,
less alarming than she had expected, though
in some respects less satisfactory; for she
had never doubted but that the mistress’s
report would at once decide her either for or
against the maid, which did not prove to be
the case. She told Ella the girl was honest,
and sober, and knew her work well, but that
on the other hand she was disobliging and
pert in her manners.</p>

<p>These serious drawbacks would, of course,
have decided Ella against her, but that being
naturally a shrewd observer, she could not
help being struck by the lady’s imperious
manner, and very unpleasant, dictatorial way
of speaking, which so disagreeably impressed
her that she made up her mind
there was probably a good deal of excuse for
the girl, and resolved, if Mrs. Mobberly
consented, to give her a trial.</p>

<p>This lady not only agreed, but warmly
commended Ella for being observant, and
added that she was sure servants had often a
great deal to put up with from unjust and unreasonable
mistresses, who would goad them
into speaking rudely by their overbearing
manners, or make it almost impossible for
them to get their work done properly by constantly
calling them off from it to attend to
other things; and then, having the poor girls’
characters entirely in their hands, ruin their
chances by blaming them for faults which they
themselves had caused.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Ella sent for the girl
again, told her the whole truth about the
interview with her mistress, and asked how
she came to have a character of that sort; to
which the girl replied at once, with a straightforward
manner which convinced Ella she
was speaking the truth, that she had stayed
longer at the place than any other servant she
knew of, and that they all had the same
character given them on leaving, the fact
being that the mistress kept nagging at them
all day long, and spoke in such a disagreeable
way to them that she tried their tempers
almost beyond endurance, and she was afraid
that sometimes it was true, they were driven
into answering her rudely.</p>

<p>So the matter was arranged, and very
shortly afterwards the household settled down
again into quietness and peace, with Mrs.
Moore, the good widow, in charge of the
house in general and the kitchen in particular,
and Sarah, the “pert and disobliging” girl,
to act under her supervision, as house and
parlour maid. The very first day of their
arrival, Ella, prompted, of course, by her
aunt, explained to them both the rules of the
house; that all windows and doors must be
fastened by ten o’clock every night, that they
must ask permission before inviting visitors to
the kitchen, though leave would always be
gladly given for suitable friends and at suitable
times; and the same applied to going
out. There were a few other matters Mrs.
Wilson was particular about; that breakages
or accidents of any sort should be reported
to her at once, and not left to be found out
accidentally; and that as good wages were
given, there should be no perquisites of any
sort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson had a very great objection to
clandestine “followers,” but saw no reason
why servants should not be as openly engaged
to be married as their young mistresses; so as
soon as she found that the new maid, Sarah,
had a “young man,” whom she ascertained
to be a thoroughly respectable young
mechanic, she told her she might invite him
to the house once a fortnight, and to begin
with, he might come to tea and go to church
with her the following Sunday, but she must
invariably come straight home after church,
as Mrs. Wilson greatly disapproved of young
women being out after church time: “If they
must have a walk,” she said, “they could go
before church, but all girls were better at
home late in the evening.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore turned out to be a great help
among the poultry, and relieved Ella’s mind
greatly by her knowledge and cleverness with
them. Almost her first work among them was
to “set” two of the hens. She showed Ella
how to make their nests in a secluded corner
where the other fowls would not disturb them,
and to arrange them so that they could not
steal each other’s eggs. Then she selected the
eggs, refusing the extra large ones that Ella
suggested, and taking only well-formed,
medium-sized ones.</p>

<p>“It is rather early in the year yet, miss, so
we won’t give them too many eggs. It is
better to get all out of a small sitting, than a
few out of a large one. They are good-sized
hens, though, so I think we will give them eight
eggs each.”</p>

<p>The nests were made of hay, from which
the longest stalks had been removed; and all
round the nests Mrs. Moore scattered a thick
layer of ashes.</p>

<p>When all was ready she brought one of
the hens and put her near the nest. Directly
the hen saw the eggs she went straight to
them, and with a contented chuckle settled
herself on them, carefully arranging them with
her beak and legs. The other hen was not
quite so quick, and preferred taking a survey
of the premises first, but after a time she
also settled herself, and they were left for their
three weeks’ solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Every morning they were turned out to
take their daily meal, and to dust their
feathers with the dry sand and ashes provided
for them at one corner of the run. In their
anxiety about their precious eggs they would
sometimes have omitted this duty, but Mrs.
Moore was firm, and explained to Ella that it
would be bad both for the hens and the eggs
if they never left their nests.</p>

<p>Ella soon took a great interest in the hens,
and became quite clever in lifting them from
their nests (when gentle persuasion had not the
desired effect), and after a little practice learnt
to accomplish it without either pulling out the
whole nest or jerking an egg or two out with
the hen.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE RED FARM.</p>

  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_316.jpg" alt="I" />

<p> perceived a
great change in
Mrs. Markham
after my mistress’s
visit. She
took less notice
of the children,
sent fewer messages
to the
nursery, ceased
to interfere in the nursery arrangements,
and often ignored my presence if she
chanced to meet me in the hall or
garden. Her manner convinced me
that she was deeply offended by her
sister’s patronage of me. Very probably
Mr. Morton had spoken a few
forcible words in my defence. They
made her understand that they trusted
me implicitly, and that any interference
in my department would be displeasing
to them. It was easy to read this from
her averted looks.</p>

<p>Now and then I heard a word or two
about “Violet,” “ridiculous infatuation,”
when I passed the open drawing-room
door. Rolf once asked me curiously
why his mother disliked me so. “You
aren’t so very wicked, are you, Fenny?
Is it very wicked to be stuck up? Mother
is so fond of using that word, you
know.”</p>

<p>I tried not to listen to Rolf. I could
afford to be magnanimous, for I was
very happy just then. Gay’s partiality
for me was evident, and I soon conceived
the warmest attachment for her.
She seized every opportunity of running
up to the nursery for a few minutes’ chat,
and she often joined us on the beach.
One afternoon she asked to accompany
us in a country ramble. Hannah had
gone to Wheeler’s Farm to have tea
with Molly, and Luke was to walk home
with her in the evening. I thought how
they would enjoy that walk through the
cornfields and down the dim, scented
lanes. Life would look as sweet to them
as to richer lovers; youth and health
and love being the three-fold cord that
cannot lightly be broken. Gay made
the excuse that she would be useful in
taking care of Joyce while I wheeled
Reggie in his perambulator, I overheard
her saying to Mrs. Markham, but her
speech only elicited a scornful reply.</p>

<p>“If Miss Fenton encourages Hannah
in gadding about, there is not the
slightest need for you to take her place,
Gay; but, of course, you will please
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I always please myself, Addie,”
returned Gay, cheerfully, “and I shall
enjoy a gambol among the lanes.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, we had a delightful afternoon
gathering wild flowers, and resting
ourselves in any shady corner where a
fallen tree or stile invited us.</p>

<p>We were gathering some poppies that
grew among the corn when Gay called
me. She looked a little anxious.</p>

<p>“Merle, I am really afraid there is a
storm coming up. You were noticing
just now how close and sultry it felt;
those clouds look ominous, and we are a
mile and a half from Marshlands.”</p>

<p>I felt conscience-stricken at her words.
We had been talking and laughing, and
had not perceived how the sunshine had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">{317}</span>
faded. Certainly, the clouds had a lurid,
thunderous look, and the birds were
flying low, and seemed fussy and uncertain
in their movements. True, the
storm might not break on us for another
half-hour; but we should never get the
children home in that time. I thought
of Reggie with dismay.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Miss Gay?” I
returned, hurriedly. “It would be nearer
to Wheeler’s Farm. We might take
refuge there.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” was her answer;
“we shall be drenched before we get
there. The Red Farm is not half a mile
off. I think we had better take the
children there, and then Mr. Hawtry
will send us home in his waggonette.
Come—come! Why do you hesitate,
Merle? He is father’s old friend; and
even Adelaide would find no fault with
us if we took refuge at the Red Farm.”</p>

<p>I held my peace, for of course Miss
Cheriton must know what her father and
sister would approve; but I did not like
the notion at all, and I followed her
somewhat reluctantly down the field.
I would much rather have gone to
Wheeler’s Farm and put ourselves
under Molly’s protection. Most likely
they would have placed a covered cart
or waggon at our disposal, and we
should all have enjoyed the fun. Gay
was so simple and unconventional, that
she saw no harm at all in going to the
Red Farm; but I knew what Aunt
Agatha would say, and I took all my
notions of propriety from her.</p>

<p>But the fates were against us, for just
as we reached the stile there was Squire
Hawtry himself, mounted as usual on
Brown Peter, trotting quietly home. He
checked Peter at once, and spoke in
rather a concerned voice.</p>

<p>“Miss Cheriton, this is very imprudent.
There will be a storm directly.
Those children will never get home.”</p>

<p>He spoke to her, but I fancied he
meant that reproachful look for me.
No doubt I was the one to blame.</p>

<p>“It was very wrong,” I stammered;
“but we were talking, and did not
notice. I want Miss Cheriton to hurry
to Wheeler’s Farm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” he said, abruptly;
but it was such a pleasant abruptness;
“the Red Farm is a mile nearer. Give
the little girl to me, Miss Fenton, and
then you can walk on quickly. I will
soon have her under shelter.”</p>

<p>There was no disputing this sensible
advice, and as soon as Peter was trotting
on with his double burden I followed as
quickly as possible with Reggie. We
were only just in time, after all. As I
wheeled Reggie under the porch of the
Red Farm the first heavy drops pattered
down.</p>

<p>I was in such haste, that I only stole
a quick glance at the low red house, with
its curious mullioned windows and stone
porch. I had noticed, as we came up
the gravel walk, a thick privet hedge,
and a yew walk, and a grand old walnut
tree in the centre of the small lawn with
a circular seat. There were seats, too,
in the porch, and a sweet smell of jasmine
and clematis. Then the door
opened, and there stood Mr. Hawtry,
with a beaming face, and Joyce beside
him, evidently pleased to welcome us all
to the Red Farm.</p>

<p>I lifted Reggie out of the perambulator
and carried him into the hall. It had
some handsome oak furniture in it:
heavy carved cabinets and chairs, and
a tall clock. There was a tiger skin
lying before the fireplace. An open
glass door led into a charming old-fashioned
garden, with a bowling-green
and a rustic arbour, and a long, straight
walk, bordered with standard rosetrees.</p>

<p>A tall, thin woman, with a placid face
and grey hair, shook hands with Gay.
Mr. Hawtry introduced her to me as
“Mrs. Cornish, my worthy housekeeper,”
and then bade her, with good-humoured
peremptoriness, “to get tea ready as
soon as possible in the oak room.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid the drawing-room has
rather a chilly aspect,” he continued,
throwing open a door. “Should you
not prefer sitting in my den, Miss Gay,
until Mrs. Cornish tells us tea is
ready?”</p>

<p>I was sorry when Miss Cheriton pronounced
in favour of the den. I liked
the look of that drawing-room, with its
three long, narrow windows opening on
to the bowling-green. It had faint,
yellowish panelled walls and an old-fashioned
blue couch, and there was
some beautiful china on an Indian
cabinet. No doubt that was where his
mother and Miss Agnes used to sit.
Perhaps the room held sad memories for
him, and he was glad to close the door
upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawtry’s den was a small front
room, with a view of the privet hedge
and the walnut tree, and was plainly
furnished with a round table and well-worn
leather chairs, the walls lined with
mahogany bookshelves, his gun and a
pair of handsomely-mounted pistols
occupying the place of honour over the
mantelpiece. Joyce called it an ugly
room, but I thought it looked comfortable
and home-like, with its pleasant
litter of magazines and papers, and Gay
said at once—</p>

<p>“I do like this old den of yours, Mr.
Hawtry; it is such a snug room,
especially in winter, when father and I
have come in after a long, cold ride.”</p>

<p>“You do not come as often now, Miss
Gay,” he said, looking at her a little
keenly.</p>

<p>She coloured, as though the remark
embarrassed her, and seemed bent on
excusing herself.</p>

<p>“I am such a busy person, you see,
and now I spend all my leisure time with
the children. Am I not a devoted aunt,
Merle?”</p>

<p>“You are very good to give us so
much of your company,” I returned, for
I saw she wanted me to speak; but just
then a flash of lightning frightened
Joyce away from the window, and she
came to me for protection. Reggie, too,
began to cry, and I had some trouble
in pacifying him.</p>

<p>Gay good-naturedly came to my
assistance.</p>

<p>“Supposing we take the children into
the other room and show them the shells;
it would distract their attention from the
storm. We will leave you to read your
paper in peace, Mr. Hawtry.” But he
insisted on going with us. The cabinet
had a curious lock, he assured us, and
no one could open it but himself.</p>

<p>The children were delighted with the
shells, and a little green Indian idol
perfectly fascinated Reggie. He kissed
the grinning countenance with intense
affection, and murmured, “Pretty,
pretty.” My attention was attracted to
a miniature in a velvet frame. It was
a portrait of a round-faced, happy-looking
girl, with brown eyes, rather like
Mr. Hawtry’s.</p>

<p>“That was my sister Agnes,” he said,
with a sigh, and for a moment his face
clouded over. “She died two years
ago, after years of intense suffering.
That miniature was painted when she
was eighteen. She was a bright, healthy
creature then. Look, that was her
couch, where she spent her days. There is
a mystery in some lives, Miss Fenton.
I never understood why she was permitted
to suffer all these years.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” observed Gay, who
had heard this. “Violet and I were so
fond of her; she could be so merry in
spite of her pain. I think some of my
pleasantest hours have been spent in
this room. How pleased she used to be
when I had anything new to tell her or
show her. I do not wonder you miss
her, Mr. Hawtry; I have always been
so sorry for you.”</p>

<p>I thought he seemed sorry for himself,
for I had never seen him look so sad. I
wished then that Gay had not brought
us back to this room; it was evidently
full of relics of the past, when womanly
hands had busied themselves for the
comfort of the dearly-loved son and
brother.</p>

<p>The little round table beside the
couch, with its inlaid workbox and
stand of favourite books, must have
been Miss Agnes’s, but the netting case
and faded silk bag on the other side of
the fireplace, with the spectacles lying
on the closed Bible, must have belonged
to the mother. How sorely must he
have missed them! Few men would have
cared to have preserved these little
homely treasures; they would have
swept them away with the dead past.
But now and then a strong manly character
has this element of feminine tenderness.</p>

<p>I think my look must have expressed
sympathy, for Mr. Hawtry came up to
me as I stood alone by the window (for
Gay was still showing the shells to the
children) and said, a little abruptly—</p>

<p>“It is good of you to be sorry for me,
but time heals all wounds, and, in spite
of pain and loneliness, one would not
call them back to suffer.” And then his
voice changed to a lower key. “I wish
Agnes could have known you, Miss Fenton;
how she would have sympathised
with your work. All good women are
fond of little children, but she doated on
them. There were crowds of children in
the churchyard on the day she was
buried.”</p>

<p>I was too much touched to answer,
but he went on as though he did not
notice my silence.</p>

<p>“You seem very happy in your
work?”</p>

<p>“Very happy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">{318}</span></p>

<p>“One can see that; you have a most
contented expression; it almost makes
one envy you. I wonder how you came
to think such work was possible.”</p>

<p>I do not know how it was, but I found
myself telling Mr. Hawtry all about
Aunt Agatha and the cottage at Putney.
I had even let fall a word or two about
my miserable deficiency. I am not sure
what I said, but I certainly saw him
smile as though something amused
him.</p>

<p>I was almost sorry when Mrs. Cornish
called us into the oak room, and yet a
most pleasant hour followed. Mrs.
Cornish poured out the tea, and the
children were very good; even Reggie
behaved quite nicely. The room was
very dark and low, and furnished entirely
with oak, but a cheery little fire
burnt on the hearth; and though the
thunder rain beat heavily against the
window, it seemed only to add to our
merriment. Mr. Hawtry had promised
to drive us home in the waggonette, but
we dared not venture until the storm was
over.</p>

<p>When the children had finished their
bread and honey they played about the
room, while we gathered round the
window.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawtry spoke most to Gay, and
I sat by and listened. He spoke about
Mr. Rossiter presently.</p>

<p>“I think him a capital fellow,” he
said, in his hearty manner; “and it quite
puzzles me why Mrs. Markham dislikes
him so; she is always finding fault with
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is no accounting for
Adelaide’s likes and dislikes,” replied
Gay, a little impatiently. “Sometimes I
think she would have found fault with
St. Paul himself if she had known him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hawtry laughed. “Rossiter is
not a St. Paul, certainly, but he is a
downright honest fellow, and that is
what I like. Perhaps he is not a shining
light in the pulpit, but he is so earnest
and painstaking, that we cannot blame
his want of eloquence. He is just the
companion that suits me; always cheerful
and always good-tempered, and ready
to talk on any subject. I must say I am
rather partial to Walter Rossiter.”</p>

<p>Now I wonder what made Gay look so
pleased, and why her eyes beamed so
softly on Mr. Hawtry. But she said
nothing, and Mr. Rossiter’s name soon
dropped out of the conversation.</p>

<p>Very shortly after that the rain cleared
and the waggonette was ordered. While
we were waiting for it, Gay asked me to
come with her into the dairy to see
Lydia Sowerby. I was anxious to see
Hannah’s sister, but I own I was not
prepossessed with her appearance. She
had red hair, like Molly—indeed, most
of the Sowerbys had red hair—but she
was far plainer than Molly, and it struck
me her face looked hard.</p>

<p>I was to own by-and-by, however, that
first impressions may be wrong, for a few
moments afterwards, when Mrs. Cornish
carried Reggie into the dairy, Lydia’s
hard-featured face softened in a wonderful
manner, and such a pleasant smile
redeemed her plainness.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let me hold him a moment,”
she said, eagerly; “he reminds me of
little Davie, our poor little brother who
died. Hannah has talked so much about
him.” And when Mrs. Cornish relinquished
him reluctantly, she carried him
about the dairy with such pride and joy,
that Mrs. Cornish nodded her head at
her benignantly.</p>

<p>“You are a rare one for children,
Lyddy; I never saw a woman to beat
you. She is always begging me to ask
Dan,” she went on, turning to us.
“She spoils Dan hugely, and so does
Molly; they are both of them soft-hearted,
though you would not believe it
to look at them, but many a soft fruit
has a rough rind,” finished Mrs.
Cornish.</p>

<p>Reggie was asleep all the way home,
but Joyce prattled incessantly. I took
them into the house as quietly as I could,
after bidding Mr. Hawtry good-night.
I thought it best to leave Gay to explain
things to Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>But all that evening, until I slept, a
sentence of Mr. Hawtry’s haunted me.
“I wish my sister Agnes could have
known you, Miss Fenton.” Why did he
wish that? And yet, and yet I should
have been glad to have known Agnes
Hawtry, too.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">An Infirm Tribunal.</span><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The fact has been mentioned above of
Camille Desmoulins’ stutter, which indomitable
perseverance and enthusiasm in his
chosen cause so far threw into the shade as
that it proved no drawback to his attainment
of a pre-eminent position in those troublous
times.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged as a somewhat
singular circumstance that another of the
revolutionary chiefs suffered from an affliction
that would appear a still more certain impediment
to success in public life. Couthon,
while yet an obscure provincial advocate in
Auvergne, was stricken with paralysis, which
deprived him of the use of his limbs. Yet
Couthon, thus laid past, as it might seem, once
and for all, on life’s most obscure and dismal
shelf—Couthon was no longer in Auvergne,
but in Paris, in the forefront of the fiercest
turmoil! Couthon, the paralytic, formed the
third of the famous Triumvirate which exercised
for above a year—an age in revolutionary
times—the Dictatorship of France.</p>

<p>It is another rather curious fact about this
man that, in spite of his grievous infirmity, he
is represented as a person of engaging aspect
and noble presence. When any measures of
peculiar severity were to be proposed, he was
always chosen by the committee to bring them
forward, and he was remarkable for uttering
the most atrocious and pitiless sentiments in a
tone and with a manner the most affectionate
and tender. The details of those wholesale
murders, the Fournées, or Batches, as they
were grimly termed, which marked the last
and most sanguinary month of the Reign of
Terror, were left to the unflinching hands of
this pitiless, soft-seeming Couthon, and the
suspicious, ferocious St. Just.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Proud and Ungrateful.</span>—Never was
any person remarkably ungrateful who was
not also insufferably proud, nor anyone proud
who was not equally ungrateful.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Way of the World.</span>—When two
people disagree, each person tells her own
story as much to the disadvantage of the
other as she possibly can. The rule of the
world on these occasions is to believe much of
the evil which each says of the other, and very
little of the good which each says of herself.
Both, therefore, suffer.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Mothers-in-Law.</span>—“Yes,” said a mother-in-law,
“you can deceive your guileless little
wife, young man, but her father’s wife—never!”</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Obedient Husband.</span></p>

<p>A clergyman, travelling through the village
of Kettle, in Fifeshire, was called into an inn
to officiate at a marriage, instead of the parish
minister, who, from some accident, was unable
to attend, and had caused the company to
wait for a considerable time.</p>

<p>While the reverend gentleman was pronouncing
the admonition, and just as he had
told the bridegroom to love and honour his
wife, the said bridegroom interjected the
words, “and obey,” which he thought had
been omitted from oversight, though that is
part of the rule laid down solely to the wife.
The minister, surprised to find a husband
willing to be henpecked by anticipation, did
not take advantage of the proposed amendment;
on which the bridegroom again
reminded him of the omission. “Ay, and obey,
sir—love, honour, and obey, ye ken!” and he
seemed seriously discomposed at finding that
his hint was not taken.</p>

<p>Some years after the same clergyman was
riding through the village, when the same
man came out and stopped him, addressing
him in the following remarkable words:
“D’ye mind, sir, yon day, when ye married
me, and when I wad insist upon vowing to
obey my wife? Weel, ye may now see that I
was in the richt. Whether ye wad or no, I
hae obeyed my wife; and behold, I am now
the only man that has a twa-storey house in
the hale toun!”</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A Natural Explanation.</span>—The greater
longevity of women as compared with men
appears to be well borne out by the statistics
of every country that has yet been examined.
This shows that, after all, it is not bright
dresses, heavy skirts, and thin shoes that
kill. It is the paying for them that does it.</p>

calamity has been suffered, the first thing to
be remembered is how much has been escaped.—<i>Dr.
Johnson.</i></p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">A Gipsy Trick.</span></p>

<p>The feat known by the gipsies as “the
great secret,” is performed by inducing
some woman of largely magnified faith—say
some decent farmer’s wife—to believe that
there is hidden in the house a magic treasure,
which can only be made to come to hand by
depositing in the cellar another treasure, to
which it will come by natural affinity or
attraction.</p>

<p>“For gold, as you sees, my dearie, draws
gold, and so if you ties up all your money in a
pockethandkerchief and leaves it, you’ll find
it doubled. And wasn’t there the squire’s
lady, and didn’t she draw two hundred gold
guineas out of the ground when they’d laid in
an old grave—and only one guinea she gave
me for all my trouble; and I hope you’ll do
better by the poor old gipsy, my dearie.”</p>

<p>The gold and all the spoons are tied up—for
as the enchantress observes, there may be
silver, too—and she solemnly repeats over it
certain magical rhymes. The next day the
gipsy comes to see how the charm is working.
Could anyone look under her cloak she might
find another bundle precisely resembling the
one containing the treasure. She looks at the
precious deposit, repeats her rhyme again and
departs, after carefully charging the housewife
that the bundle must not be touched or
spoken about for three weeks. “Every word
you tell about it, my dearie, will be a guinea
gone away.” Sometimes she exacts an oath
on the Bible that nothing shall be said.</p>

<p>Back to the farmer’s wife never again.
After three weeks another extraordinary
instance of gross incredulity appears in the
country papers, and is perhaps repeated in a
colossal London daily, with a reference to the
absence of the schoolmaster. There is wailing
and shame in the house—perhaps great
suffering, for it may be that the savings of
years have been swept away. The charm has
worked.—<i>Leland.</i></p>

<h3>MUSIC.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Allegro.</span>—The madrigal (a pastoral song) and the
glee are not the same. The musical phrases in the
former, complete in themselves, seldom went together
in the different voice parts. One phrase
began before the ending of the other, as it were
over-lapping one another. It was usually sung in
chorus, whereas glees were sung in single voices. A
catch is of old English origin, as remote as the
early days of the Tudors. Several voices are
engaged, one catching up the words of the other in a
whimsical and burlesque fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Claire Elliot.</span>—We think we must refer you to our
numberless valuable articles on music, which run all
through the seven volumes, “Evenings with Our
Great Living Composers,” in vol. iv., especially. The
dress you mention would not be too handsome and
full dress to wear in London, but we do not know
for what kind of a concert you require it. There are
concerts and concerts, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An old Maid of 24.</span>—The verse you quote is from a
song called “Rock me to Sleep, Mother.” Of
course, if young ladies call on other young ladies and
do not make acquaintance with the lady of the
house, be she mother or sister-in-law, there is no
need of inviting them (the visitors) to the house as
guests. But a girl of any tact will avoid this
trouble by being very particular that her young
friends be introduced to the elders of her family.
In England, few mothers like their daughters to go
out without them; if in society at all, they must have
a chaperon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie M. C. B.</span>—The names of all the best of the
new songs are given in the reviews in the G.O.P., to
which you must refer for information. There is a
valuable article by Miss Mary Davies in vol i. on
“How to Improve the Voice.” She thinks an egg
beaten up with a little milk and sugar and taken an
hour before singing is good.</p>
</div>


<h3>ART.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">An Art Student.</span>—Copies from old masters have a
very limited sale, and picture dealers are generally
shy of buying them. The best exhibitions for their
display are the agricultural shows held during the
summer months in various country towns. These
shows have a special exhibit of art work, and a class to
which copies are admitted. Should your own promise
as an artist be very decided, and your means
permit, you would do well to go to Rome, Dresden,
or to Belgium, where copies of the old masters can
be made, which find a sale amongst English and
American visitors to the galleries, and a fair price is
obtained. Standing for long periods of time at an
ordinary easel is very injurious to girls. Easels are
constructed so as to be raised or lowered at will, and
enable the artist to sit while at work.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">A Constant Reader.</span>—1. The whole account of the
royal mummies recently discovered in Egypt appeared,
and with illustrations, in one of the numbers
for August of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.
Neither of these was the Pharaoh who was drowned
in the Red Sea. But even had it been so, what
insuperable obstacles would have necessarily existed
to the recovery of the king’s body, and its being embalmed
and buried! 2. We do not believe England to
be the worst country in the world for drunkenness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver Thread</span> should recommend her friends to
read a recent article of ours on the care of the hair;
and should read that by Medicus on “Lissom Hands
and Pretty Feet,” besides continual answers to
similar questions in our correspondence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nil Desperandum.</span>—1. It would be cheaper and more
satisfactory to buy a sixpenny bottle of lemon kali,
than attempt to make it yourself. 2. An account of
all the old castles in England could be obtained by
your bookseller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Highland Lass.</span>—1. To cover a bedroom mantelpiece,
you can employ the ordinary furniture brocade sold
for that purpose. A yard and a half will suffice.
They have a woven flower design in the centre, and are
finished with a fringe of the same material. The
colours are rich in hue, and
gold threads are usually run
through the pattern. 2.
Dec. 3rd, 1873, was a Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phœbe.</span>—1. The sect of the
Epicureans (according to St.
Gregory of Nyssa) believed
that all things moved on
accidentally, without any
Providence. A very remarkable
regularity, we
must admit, of times and
seasons, causes and results,
are for mere accidents!
Such accidents are as full
of apparent method as there
was in Hamlet’s madness.
Alas! there are many silly
epicureans in the present
day, only known by a different
name. 2. The name
Shiloh means the peacemaker,
and Messiah the
anointed. The word catechism
is derived from the
Greek, signifying to instruct
by oral teaching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Subscriber’s Brother.</span>—You
will spoil your gaselier
if you attempt to lacquer it
yourself. Send it to a lamp
shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nymphæ Alba.</span>—You might
procure botanists’ portable
collecting presses at Swiss
wood-carving shops. For
drying and preserving
flowers refer to vol. iii.,
page 80.</p>

<p>R. E. W.—You say that, when
you pray, you seem to speak
to the air, and feel quite
discouraged. You probably
think of your Heavenly
Father as far away above
the heavens, instead of close
at your side and in your
chamber, knowing all your
thoughts and desires before
you utter them. Try to
realise this. See Psalm
cxxxix., and all our Lord’s
words as to being in the
midst of two or three praying
in His name, etc. Then,
again, you pray amiss even when asking for such
spiritual grace and such temporal mercies as are
agreeable to His will, because you do not fulfil all
the conditions He has imposed on you. “When
ye pray, believe that ye have the things, and ye
shall have them.” “If ye shall ask anything in
My name, I will do it.” If you ask in His name,
therefore, and do not accept and believe in His
promise, you cannot expect to receive what you
need with any degree of confidence. “All things
are possible to him that believeth.” “Ask and ye
shall receive, that your joy may be full.” “Him
that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span>—1. We regret that we cannot promise any special
competitions. The time they exact from an editor is
far greater than our competitors can realise. 2. It is
very ungrammatical to divide the verb from the preposition
“to.” You should not say “to accordingly
act,” but “to act accordingly.” There is no such
verb as “to accordingly.” The adverb should end
the sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Zealand, An English Girl.</span>—We think your
friends should get on anywhere. You do not give
address; but you can write to the London office of
the United Englishwoman’s Emigration Association,
Mrs. Reeves, 13, Dorset-square, Baker-street, W.,
for information and advice on all subjects connected
with the emigration of women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Natalie</span> and <span class="smcap">Berea</span>.—1. A kind of pancake feast preceding
Lent was observed in the Greek Church, from
whom we may probably have borrowed it, together
with the Pasch-eggs, and other suchlike things, so
we are informed in Brand’s “Popular Antiquities.”
2. Anyone who exchanges any kind of goods to receive
old used postage stamps in exchange does so to
defraud the Government. Such stamps are submitted
to a process which makes them appear like new, and
are privately issued. Thus, we warn you of aiding
and abetting swindlers. We are already provided
with a very full staff of writers, and regret we cannot
invite you to write for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Buttercup.</span>—Hot mineral springs boil up
from volcanic action under ground, and which
become impregnated with mineral substances. The
hot springs at Bath were known to the Romans in
the first century, who had a station there called
<i>Aquæ Solis</i>, or <i>Aquæ Calidæ</i>, and to the English
conquerors as Bathan. But the discovery of the
healing properties of the Bath waters dates back to
the time of Bladud, the father of King Lear, who
consequently built the city, one of the wells of which
was called Bladud’s Well. Any little handbook of
Bath will give you the whole history of his discovery
of them, and the cure of the diseased swine from

<p><span class="smcap">J. Noel.</span>—The origin of the word “ostracism” is
Greek, and the founder of this arbitrary law was
Clisthenes, the leader of an advanced Democratic
party in Athens. It provided for the banishment of
any individual, however innocent of crime, who was
obnoxious to the citizens, because too influential in
their estimation, or disposed to restrict their own
liberty of action. Their votes for his exile were recorded
by the inscription of his name on the shells.
The “biter bitten” was demonstrated in the case of
this demagogue, as Clisthenes was himself the first
on whom his own law was put in force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plural Noun</span> sent us the following riddle some time

<p>A. M. W.—1. You might perhaps repair your waterproof
by making the following solution:—Dissolve an ounce
of isinglass in a pound of soft water, and a quarter
of an ounce of soap in one pound of water, all separately.
Strain the solutions, mix them, and let them
simmer for some time. Brush the preparation while
hot over the worn spot, and when dry brush it well
and lay on a little more. In a day or two you may
wear the garment. 2. Yes, seals can hear very well,
and, what is more, they enjoy music, and they have
been known to follow a ship for miles to listen to the
playing of a violin on board.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span>—A list of nine prayer unions and Scripture-reading
societies is given in the little shilling manual
of girls’ clubs just published by Messrs Griffith and
Farran, corner of St. Paul’s-churchyard, E.C. The
most considerable is that of the Rev. T. Richardson.
We recommend the manual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span>—1. In calling on a
newly-married couple for
the first time, both husband
and wife should call in
person. After that the wife
may leave her own card,
should the lady be out, and
two of her husband’s. As
“Patsy” is the diminutive
of “Patrick,” we presume
our correspondent to be a
man. 2. The harp is not a
difficult instrument to play,
provided you have a good
ear, as it has to be tuned
continually. You should go
to a shop for musical instruments,
and, if economy be
essential, you might procure
a secondhand one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Lover of the G. O. P.</span>—1.
At one time there was no
intercourse between the
people of Coventry and the
soldiers garrisoned there,
and hence arose the phrase
being “sent to Coventry,”
where the soldiers were
doomed to know nobody,
and a woman seen speaking
to one of them was immediately
tabooed. 2. Canaries
are kept in wire cages. See
that yours be a large one,
and keep the wooden perches
well scraped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yttria Laver.</span>—Have you
ever read the “Boston Monday
Lectures,” by the Rev.
Joseph Cook (Ward and
Lock, Warwick House,
Salisbury-sq., E.C.)? The
vols. “Life and the Soul”
and “God and the Conscience”
are admirable, and
well suited for the sceptical.
A supreme divinity could
not be created, as then he
would not be supreme. He
must be self-existent. The
arguments you name are
very feeble. Being omnipresent,
of course He is
in every corner of His
dominion. See the 139th
Psalm, 8th verse.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
